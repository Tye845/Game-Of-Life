# Game-Of-Life
Implements mathematician John Conway's Game Of Life in Java.

Conway's Game of Life simulates the birth and death of cells within a rectangular grid. The state of a given cell in any generation depends on the state of the cell and its eight immediate neighbors in the preceding generation, according to 2 rules:

If a living cell has two or three neighbors, it remains living; otherwise it dies of loneliness or overcrowding.
If an empty cell has exactly three neighbors, it becomes living; otherwise, it remains dead.
